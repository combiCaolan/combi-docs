# Interlock Management

CAUTION: these options are only to be used if the truck needs to be moved into a safe place when it has a fault. It is not to be used for normal operation. 

In case of a fault in the truck, different options are available to try to override that fault and get the truck into operating mode. 

After a keyswitch, interlock overrides are automatically switched OFF.
