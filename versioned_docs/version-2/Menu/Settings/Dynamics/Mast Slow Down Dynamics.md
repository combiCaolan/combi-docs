# Carriage Slow Down Dynamics


In the mast slow down dynamics screen, you will be able to change the parameters relating to the masts speed when lifting and lowering, when this feature is enabled

Lower Stop Position Enable – If ON, lower stop position will stop mast if/when it reaches that height

Lower Stop Position – The lowest position mast can lower to

Lower Slow Down Distance – The distance from lower stop position when mast slows down

Lower Stop Speed – Limited to percentage of current max lower speed when mast slows down

Higher Stop Position Enable – If ON, higher stop position will stop mast if/when it reaches that height

Higher Stop Position – The highest position the mast can lift to

Higher Slow Down Distance – The distance from higher stop position when mast slows down

Higher Stop Speed – Limited to percentage of current max lift speed when mast slows down

Stage 1 Transition Enable – If ON, when the mast goes from stage 1 to stage 2, mast slows down to ensure a smooth transition. 

Stage 1 Transition Position – Height at which stage 1 transitions into stage 2 

Stage 2 Transition Enable – If ON, when the mast goes from stage 2 to 
stage 3 or from stage 2 to stage 1, mast slows down to ensure a smooth transition.

Stage 2 Transition Position – Height at which stage 2 transitions into stage 3

Stage 3 Transition Enable – If ON, when the mast goes from stage 2 to 
stage 3, mast slows down to ensure a smooth transition.

Stage 3 Transition Position – Height at which stage 3 transitions into 
stage 2

Stage Above Slow Down Distance – Distance from stage above position when mast slows down to ensure smooth transition

Stage Above Slow Down Speed – Percentage of current max lift speed mast is limited to when transitioning stages

Stage Below Slow Down Distance – Distance from stage below position when mast slows down to ensure smooth transition

Stage Above Slow Down Speed – Percentage of current max lift speed mast is limited to when transitioning stages
Slow Down Inverted – Invert the slow down
