# Hyraulic Functions

In the hydraulics functions screen, you will be able to change the parameters relating to the trucks hydraulic functions parameters 
Not all the options might be available or applicable for your truck.

There are 11 slots that can be selected to configure the hydraulic functions from the truck. 

Hydraulic Function – Cycles between the pre-defined hydraulic functions. 

Speeds – Start, Mid and Max pump speeds for each direction of the selected function. 

Input Type – Hydraulic input e.g. levers fingertips etc. 

Return to neutral – If throttle needs to return to neutral before activating the hydraulic function 

Hyd Section switch – Switch to be activated before using the hydraulic function 

Feedback Switches – If there is feedback from hydraulic function active.

Joystick Direction – The direction you want the function to be operated from e.g left/right or forward/reverse.

Joystick button – if there is a button associated with that function 

Fingertip – The number of the fingertip you are using. 

Redundancy type – which type of redundancy is being used with that input. 

Output Type – Cycles between the different output types. 

Output Section – Number of the valvebank section the function is on. 

6 Ports – if the function need to control a 6-port diverter valve and the state to activate it. 

Priority if Lowest Speed – gives priority to that function if it needs the pump to run slower. 

Valve Feedback – Turn this On the function has current feedback 

Invert Direction – Inverts the direction of the hydraulic function. 

Feedback – Min and max values for the feedback (depends on the selected output type)

Ramp Up – Ramp up time of the opening of the hydraulic valve

Ramp Down – Ramp down time of the opening of the hydraulic valve

Ramp Time – Base time for the ramp. Value will change by Ramp Up/Down each Ramp Time. E.g. the value will increase by 400 every 200ms

Kp – Kp tuning value for the Current controlled outputs

Ki – Ki tuning value for the Current controlled outputs
Function Timeout – Max number of milliseconds before the function is turned OFF.
