# Steer Rear Right

In the Steer Rear Right controller screen, you will be able to observe:

The output of the steer rear right controller when not in use and performing a function, e.g. turning wheel angle.

The description tells you the function associated with the parameter

The layout of parameters and their functions for the SRR controller is the same layout parameters and functions used for the other three steer controllers

Interlock – If the circle is green then the interlock is turned ON

Home – If the circle is green the wheels are in the home position

CAN Steer Command – Steering input sent to the controller via CAN

CAN 2 Steer Command – Steering input sent to the controller via CAN

CAN Steer Counts – Number of ‘steer’ messages sent to the controller via CAN

Steer Command Degrees – How many degrees the wheels should turn based on the steer command

Steer Command – How much steering input of max possible steering input 
the steering controller is receiving

Target Position – What angle the wheel should be at

Wheel Position – What angle the wheel actually is

Wheel Position 2 – What angle the wheel actually is

Encoder 3A – If the circle is green then encoder 3A is turned ON

Encoder 3B – If the circle is green then encoder 3B is turned ON

Encoder 4B – If the circle is green then encoder 4B is turned ON

5V Out Current – Voltage the controller outputs

Motor RPM – The RPM of the steer motor

Motor Temperature – The temperature of the traction motor

Current RMS – Current inside of the controller

Traction Cutback – Percentage of speed dropped when turning 

Enable Traction – If the circle is green then traction is enabled
