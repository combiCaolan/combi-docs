# Pump

In the Pump controller screen, you will be able to observe:
The output of the pump controller when not in use and performing a hydraulic function.

The description tells you the function associated with the parameter
Note the four traction controllers that could be fitted to your truck follow the same general parameter layout to the pump controller with slight differences in names and purposes

Mast Sensor – If the voltage is high then the mast is in use

Steer Sensor – If the voltage is high then the trucks wheel(s) are turning via a mode change or steering wheel

Analog 9 – If the voltage is high then analog 9 is turned ON

Override Sw – If the circle is green the override switch is turned ON

Seat Sw – If the circle is green then the seat switch is turned ON

Seatbelt Sw – If the circle is green then the seatbelt switch is turned ON

Mast Sw2 – If the circle is green then mast switch 2 is turned ON

Mast Sw3 – If the circle is green then mast switch 3 is turned ON

Sw12 – If circle is green then switch 12 is on

Sw13 – If circle is green then switch 13 is on

Warning Light FWD – Either ON = 100% or OFF = 0%, if ON the warning light is turned ON while driving forward

Universal Ouptut1 – Either ON = 100% or OFF = 0%, if ON then the universal output 1 is turned ON

Universal Ouptut2 – Either ON = 100% or OFF = 0%, if ON then the universal output 2 is turned ON

Warning Light REV – Either ON = 100% or OFF = 0%, if ON the warning light is turned ON while reversing

Main Contactor – If the percentage is low then the main contactor is open 

Cooling Fan 1 – Either ON = 100% or OFF = 0%, if ON cooling fan is turned ON 

Lock Valves – Either ON = 100% or OFF = 0%, if ON hydraulic valves are locked

Interlock – If the circle is green then the interlock is turned ON

ThrottleCommand – How much throttle input the pump controller is receiving

BrakeCommand – How much brake input the pump controller is receiving

Regen – If the circle is green then the brake regen is ON

ControllerCurrent – The amount of current the pump controller currently has

MotorRPM – The RPM of the pump motor

MotorTemperature – The temperature of the pump motor

Current5V – Number of volts that flows through pump controller

SupplyCurrent12V – The supplied power the controller requires to power ON
