# PLC

In the PLC screen you will be able to observe:

As the I/O from the PLC can be reconfigured for every truck, it is not possible to describe the function of each one. 

To know what is connected to each pin you will need to see the electric schematics of your machine and the settings for the hydraulics. 

The first letter and digit refer to the pin ID and the description after 
is the generic controller pin description.
